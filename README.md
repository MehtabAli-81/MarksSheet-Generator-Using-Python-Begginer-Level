# Python Marksheet Generator.

This Python project is a simple marksheet generator designed for students and educators. It automates the process of creating marksheets by taking student details and subject marks as input, calculating total marks and percentages, and generating a formatted marksheet.  It's particularly useful for quickly generating marksheets for a small number of students, making it a handy tool for teachers or students who want to create their own personal marksheets.  It's also a great learning project for beginners in Python, demonstrating basic input/output, calculations, and formatted printing.
